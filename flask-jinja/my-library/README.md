# my-library

This is a small project containing basic html and python code with flask and jinja. 
The website allows to enter book names, authors and ratings to be saved . Finally a list of all books entered will be shown as a list in the home page.

(I am not interested in improving my front-end web development skills. Just trying to use a database in python code. So, its does not look nice.  )

## Ideas to be realised:

- Make the dictionary an SQLite DB
- Dockerize the code
- Use plain SQL alchemy
- Add a delete record button
- Add an edit record button
- ? maybe a button to show the book list in a specific order
- or maybe a button for filtering the list
    - which one is easier to do that? plain sqlalchemy or flask-sqlalchemy?
- Work on rating
- Add a little bir styling
